## What is a dashboard?

A dashboard is a (usually) interactive tool that allows users to visualise and explore their data. It commonly associates data from multiple tables or datasets

Examples of dashboards we have created at Hackney Council include:
- A pre-filtered set of KPIs to meet a specific requirement (eg Childrenâ€™s and Families Service Overview)
- Tool to spot emerging trends through data automation
CRM-light tool allowing users to look at tabular data (eg Jigsaw Temporary Accommodation dashboard)
- Self-serve data exploration with no prefilters (eg Civica Browser dashboard used by Public Realm)

## Two approaches to loading data into a Qlik dashboard

There are two ways to load data into Qlik:
1. By using the data load manager, which is what we recommend as the approach that new Qlik users take.
2. There is also the data load editor, which enables users to develop a script. 

It is possible to switch between the two approaches. Watch the [module 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1niTGvKwQfzotaBLptn9530S2CVLzdJ8Z/view?usp=sharing) training video to find out more about each method.

If you would like to develop Qlik dashboards, first please ensure you have read through training modules 1 and 2 and watched the accompanying videos. All training resources are documented within the Qlik **Training Modules** section of the [Data Platform](https://playbook.hackney.gov.uk/Data-Platform-Playbook/) Playbook.

Then email **data.platform@hackney.gov.uk** with a request to be given 'Power User' access.
