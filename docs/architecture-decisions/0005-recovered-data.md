## Context

Hackney have recovered a number of datasets from prior to the Cybersecurity incident, these datasets will need to be
merged with datasets created after the incident.

## Decision

Recovered datasets that are in a consumable format (json, csv, .sql) will be deposited into the landing zone directly,
using the same partition storage strategy as other data sets [see ADR 0004](0004-partition-strategy.md)

## Consequences

Anyone needing to deposit recovered data onto the Data Platform would need access to the Data Platform.
