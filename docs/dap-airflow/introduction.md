# Introduction
![DAPâ‡¨flow](../dap-airflow/images/DAPairflowFLOWwide.png)  
## What is **DAPâ‡¨flow**? 
**DAPâ‡¨flow** is an integation of ***Apache Airflow*** with ***Amazon Athena*** built upon Hackney's ***Data Analytics Platform***. 
#### It allows Data Analysts, in the simplest way possible, to develop and run data pipelines using their own service's data and create data products for their service and service users.

Building data pipelines used to be harder and more complex and time consuming. Data Analysts after prototyping their SQL queries using ***Amazon Athena*** were required to migrate Athena's SQL code to Spark SQL, a different SQL dialect, then embed their code within an ***Amazon Glue*** job. They also had to negotiate querying across multiple generations of the same data stored in the ***Amazon S3*** Data lake. That meant they could not simply take a legacy SQL query and run it in ***Amazon Athena*** or create an ***Amazon Glue*** product directly from it.

#### How **DAPâ‡¨flow** solves these problems
* Firstly, Data Analysts no longer need to use the more complex ***Amazon Glue*** because data pipelines built using ***Apache Airflow*** can use ***Amazon Athena*** to generate the data transformation products using the same prototype SQL code.  

    **This cuts development time by more than half while Data Analysts no longer need to context-switch between the two SQL dialects.**

* Secondly, Data Analysts no longer need to adapt their SQL queries to ***Amazon S3***'s Data Lake partitioning architecture, because ***Apache Airflow*** is used to generate views of the underlying table data which presents Data Analysts with only current ingested service data, in readiness for prototyping and also later on when the automated transforms are run by Airflow.

    **This further cuts development time while Data Analysts can very easily take the legacy SQL code from their service database system and run it directly on *Amazon Athena* with few changes.**

    Data Analysts can also migrate their existing Athena SQL prototypes, previously adapted for the ***Amazon S3***'s Data Lake partitioning architecture, because the table history is still available to them, although the table names will now be suffixed "**_history**".


## ðŸ“šOnboarding

#### A series onboarding documents is available here, to help Data Analysts get started with **DAPâ‡¨flow**

Anyone new to **DAPâ‡¨flow** will need read [**ðŸ“šBefore you begin**](../dap-airflow/onboarding/begin).

Thereafter, Data Analysts do not need to read every documents in the order they are listed below, especially if they are already familiar with the ***AWS Management Console*** and have used ***Amazon Athena*** before.

Data Analysts are encouraged to think about what they need to do before deciding which document to read next. For example, if they have a ***legacy SQL query*** that they want to migrate to **DAPâ‡¨flow**, they might jump straight to [**ðŸ“šPrototype legacy transforms**](../dap-airflow/onboarding/prototype-legacy-transforms).

#### ***"We* â™¡ *your feedback!"***
Your continuous feedback enables us to improve **DAPâ‡¨flow** and our ***Data Analytics Platform*** service. Survey links are provided at the end of each onboarding document.

#### Here below, is the full list of topics currently on offer...

Further documents will be added as they are developed. [**Jump to the end**](#topics-arriving-here-soon) to discover what is coming next!
