# ðŸ“šIntroduction
![DAPâ‡¨flow](../dap-airflow/images/DAPairflowFLOWwide.png)  
## What is **DAPâ‡¨flow**? 
**DAPâ‡¨flow** is an integration of ***Apache Airflow*** with ***Amazon Athena*** built upon Hackney's ***Data Analytics Platform***. 

**DAPâ‡¨flow** allows Data Analysts, in the simplest way possible, to develop and run data pipelines using their own service's data and create data products for their service and service users.

#### Building data pipelines used to be harder and more complex and time consuming. 

Data Analysts, after prototyping their SQL queries using ***Amazon Athena*** were required to convert *Athena SQL* code to *Spark SQL*, a different SQL dialect, then embed their code within an ***Amazon Glue ETL*** job which they had to deploy using ***Terraform***.  

Data Analysts were forced to query across multiple generations of the same data stored in the ***Amazon S3*** Data lake when all they actually wanted was just their current data. That meant they could not simply take legacy SQL queries and run them directly in ***Amazon Athena***.

- ##### PREVIOUSLY: Too hard + too complex = too time consuming...

- ##### FIREBREAK: Deciding what we wanted to change...

- ##### OUTCOME: DAP re-imagined using *Airflow* = **DAPâ‡¨flow**...  
![Fig. 3](./images/introduction-three.png)

#### How **DAPâ‡¨flow** solved our problems
* Firstly, Data Analysts no longer need to convert and re-test their prototype SQL transforms to run in the separate and more complex ***Amazon Glue ETL*** run-time environment. 

    Instead, ***Apache Airflow*** can use exactly the same ***Amazon Athena*** to transform data in production with the outputs going directly into data products. So that Data Analysts' prototype SQL transform queries, that they spent time on testing until they were working, can simply be reused instead of being discarded.  

    **That cuts development time by more than half while Data Analysts no longer need to context-switch between the two SQL dialects.**

* Secondly, Data Analysts no longer must adapt their legacy SQL queries to ***Amazon S3***'s Data Lake partitioning architecture. 

    Instead, ***Apache Airflow*** is configured to generate views of the underlying table data to present Data Analysts with current-only ingested service data, both in readiness for prototyping and testing, and for when the working transforms are subsequently deployed, being automated and run by Airflow.

    **That further cuts development time while Data Analysts can very easily take the legacy SQL code from their service database system and run it directly on *Amazon Athena* with few changes.**

    Data Analysts can also migrate their existing Athena SQL prototypes, previously adapted for the ***Amazon S3***'s Data Lake partitioning architecture, because the same table history is available to them, although the table names will now be suffixed "**_history**", which is more intuitive for new users.

* Lastly, Data Analysts no longer need to use ***Terraform*** for deploying their data pipeline jobs because ***Apache Airflow*** simply takes care of that as soon as they commit their transform queries to **DAPâ‡¨flow**'s ***GitHub*** repository.

## ðŸ“šOnboarding

#### A series onboarding guides to help Data Analysts get started with **DAPâ‡¨flow**

Anyone new to **DAPâ‡¨flow** will start with [**ðŸ“šBefore you begin**](../dap-airflow/onboarding/begin) followed by [**ðŸ“šWelcome!**](../dap-airflow/onboarding/welcome).

Thereafter, Data Analysts do not need to read every document in the order they are listed below, especially if they are already familiar with the ***AWS Management Console*** and have used ***Amazon Athena*** before.

Data Analysts are encouraged to think about what they need to do before deciding which document to read next. For example, if they have a ***legacy SQL query*** that they want to migrate to **DAPâ‡¨flow**, they could jump straight to [**ðŸ“šPrototype legacy transforms**](../dap-airflow/onboarding/prototype-legacy-transforms).

#### ***"We* â™¡ *your feedback!"***
Your continuous feedback enables us to improve **DAPâ‡¨flow** and our ***Data Analytics Platform*** service. Survey links are provided at the end of each onboarding document.

#### Below, is the full list of topics currently on offer...
More guides will be added when they are ready:

## ðŸ“šMigration onboarding

Users who had their SQL transforms migrated from ***Amazon Glue ETL*** to **DAPâ‡¨flow**, now have their own series of onboarding guides. After migrating to **DAPâ‡¨flow**, should start with [**ðŸ“šBefore you begin**](../dap-airflow/parking/begin) followed by [**ðŸ“šWelcome!**](../dap-airflow/parking/welcome).

### ***Amazon Glue ETL***'s legacy...

We had the freedom to replace a large part of the code-base including the **Data Platform** data model in **DAPâ‡¨flow**'s design. But that left us with the question of, how to migrate our ***Amazon Glue ETL*** users, who had already adapted their solutions around the old **Data Platform** table model. 

***Amazon Glue ETL*** users were used to incorporating generational subqueries in their SQL queries and as a result we had acquired a considerable legacy of transformations, which in turn, produced a considerable catalog of historical data, all bearing the original unsuffixed table naming convention. That, unfortunately clashed with **DAPâ‡¨flow**'s preferred naming scheme for our new users. 

**DAPâ‡¨flow**'s reason for changing our previous **Data Platform** table naming conventions was to allow users to quickly adapt the SQL brought across from their enterprise database systems. How could we adapt this for our ***Amazon Glue ETL*** users? 

For better or worse, we decided to leave those users' existing data and transformation logic intact and support the old **Data Platform** way that data was organized, including support for legacy queries in the presentation layer.

We did, however, find a reasonable compromise that would allow new transforms to be prototyped and deployed in a much simpler way. 

So, we continue to support around 80 legacy data transforms in this way and will continue to do so until the Enterprise Databases, that supply them with data, are eventually replaced or are otherwise decommissioned.

### ðŸš§Under construction

The guide contents below, represents the full list of topics currently on offer for users migrated to **DAPâ‡¨flow** from ***Amazon Glue ETL***. 

These guides were released early, before the entire guide was finished, so that feedback could be incorporate directly into the next **Release #2:**
- **Release #1:** ðŸš§Under construction *= early feedback.*
- **Release #2:** ðŸ“šMigration onboarding *= guide complete.*
- **Release #3:** ðŸ“šOnboarding *retrofit = brought back up-to-date.*

More guides will be added when they are ready...
