# Before you begin DAP‚á®flow
![DAP‚á®flow](../images/DAPairflowFLOWleft.png)  

## 1. Are you using your **Hackney Council** Google Account?
You‚Äôll always need to be logged into your **Hackney Council** Google account via your web browser when following the **DAP‚á®flow** onboarding guides.

## 2. Is your `[service]`‚Äôs data now available on the Data Analytics Platform (DAP)?
If your `[service]` manager or the **DAP Platform Team** have not already informed you about this, please visit the [**üìäData Analyst Community**](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAKdvhyKA?cls=7) *Google Chat Space* to ask the question there. Someone from the team should be able to help you, and if your `[service]`‚Äôs data isn't available right now, this might be planned for near future.

## 3. You must be added to your `[service access group]`'s [*Google Group*](https://groups.google.com/all-groups?q=saml-aws-data-platform-collaborator) 
Depending on your circumstance there are various ways that could happen:  

- If your `[service]` manager (or representative) also manages your [`[service access group]`](https://groups.google.com/all-groups?q=saml-aws-data-platform-collaborator) then you can ask them to [add you](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/2465464?hl=en). That is the quick and easy way.

- Otherwise, when **DAP‚á®flow** access is requested via any other means the **DAP Platform Team** must interact with your manager before they can add you, for example:
    * An access request directed at **Data Analytics Platform's** [***Halo support portal***](https://support.hackney.gov.uk/portal/service?btn=204&root_category=13&autolog=true&shownewticket=true&id=137) sent via [**data.analytics.platform@hackney.gov.uk**](mailto:data.analytics.platform@hackney.gov.uk). Always make sure managers are cc'd in to email so that requests can be authorized as quickly as possible and we can be sure what [service] you belong to.  
    * Asking for help via the [**üìäData Analyst Community**](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAKdvhyKA?cls=7) *Google Chat Space*.  

## 4. Access granted

**`Fig. 4`** ![Fig. 4](../images/begin-four.png)

You should receive an email, similar to ***fig.4*** above, which will confirm the *actual name* of the *Google Group* you were added to. So henceforth in the üìöOnboarding articles, wherever you read `[service access group]` you should interpret that to be the *Google Group* named in that email. 

You will then be be granted:  

üëâ  Access to the [Hackney Council AWS Console](https://d-936715b9ec.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts) 

Please allow a couple of hours for the *access permission* to propagate to [**Hackney Council AWS Console**](https://d-936715b9ec.awsapps.com/start/\#/?tab=accounts)

üëâ  Access to your `[service **‚òéÔ∏èDAP‚á®flow** Hotline]` *Google Chat Space* 

All members of the `[service access group]` with access to **DAP‚á®flow** are now automatically members of this *Google Chat Space*. This is where you will interact with the **DAP Platform Team** when you need help, encounter a problem or need to chase a request while performing some task.  

## 5. Welcome!

Please take some time to go and introduce yourself on your `[service **‚òéÔ∏èDAP‚á®flow** Hotline]`!

To get you started on your **DAP‚á®flow** journey and enable effective use of the [**DAP‚á®flowüìöOnboarding**](../introduction#üìöOnboarding) documentation, you will need certain information in the form of **Service Terms`[]`** defined for your `[service]`'s implementation. The next onboarding article will guide you through that: 

üëâ  [**DAP‚á®flowüìöWelcome**](../onboarding/welcome)  

Please note your `[service access group]` named in the email because you will need that correctly access information you will need.
