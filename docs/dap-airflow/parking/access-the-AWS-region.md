# How will I ensure I am in the correct AWS region?

You will need to check the region you are in, usually the first time you access the AWS Management Console. Thereafter your web browser will remember the region you last used so you should not need to check this very often.

## 1. Access the ***AWS Management Console***
**`üñ±`** In your web browser, log in to your AWS account to access the ***AWS Management Console***.  
   
üëâ First time AWS Users should **start here ‚ñ∫** **[üìöAWS Console access](../parking/access-the-AWS-Management-Console)** 

## 2. Locate the Region Selector
**`üëÅ`** At the top of the console, locate the region selector **`‚ñº`**.

## 3. Select Your Region
**`üñ±`** Click on the **`‚ñº`** arrow to open the region menu.  
**`üñ±`** From the list that appears, choose **`Europe (London) eu-west-2`** as your region.
