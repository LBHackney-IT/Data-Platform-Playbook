:::note BEHAVIOR  
### How will I use ***Amazon Athena*** to access my database?
**Measures** the behavior of **Amazon Athena** when first run and configured by the user:

**Given** in my web browser, I have access to the ***AWS Management Console***  
**~and** I have familiarized myself with the console interface  

**When** I open ***Amazon Athena*** via the console menu system, by clicking on “**Athena**” whereever it appears  
**~and** I click through any splash screen that might appear, eg. “**Explore the Query Editor**”  

**Then** I will be presented with the **Amazon Athena** interface  
**~and** up at the right next to “**Workgroup**”, I should be offered my `[service workgroup]` from the list-box  
**~and** over on the left under “**Database**” I should be offered my `[service zones]` from the list-box.  

**Scale** of 3 to 4 **~and** flow features.
