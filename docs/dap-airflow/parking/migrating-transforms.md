:::note BEHAVIOR  
### How can my ***Amazon Glue*** *ETL job's Spark SQL query* be migrated to **DAP‚á®flow**?
**Measures** the successful migration of an ***Amazon Glue*** *ETL job* to **DAP‚á®flow**:  

**Given** in my web browser, I have accessed ***Amazon Athena***  
**~and** I have selected my `[service workgroup]`  
**~and** ***Amazon Athena*** shows all my `[service zones]` databases  
**~and** I have my ***Glue*** *ETL job*'s `[migration SQL query]` waiting to be fashioned into **DAP‚á®flow** *transform* 

**When** I copy-and-paste my `[migration SQL query]` into the query editor  
**~and** I ensure every ***Amazon Glue*** *ETL job* input-table alias is replaced by it's actual table name  
**~and** I ensure every table name is correctly formatted and prefixed by it's `[service zones]` database name  
**~and** I ensure every column expression is translated and made compatible with ***Amazon Athena***'s SQL DML structure, functions, syntax and behavior 
**~and** I ensure the query output columns are ordered and `CAST` exactly as the original output in my ***Amazon Glue*** *ETL job*'s target `[service zones]` database and table  
**~and** I ensure the query output *partition columns* are featured at the end of the column order  
**~and** I click ‚Äú**Run**‚Äù underneath the code window on the left-hand side

**Then** ***Amazon Athena*** should fetch results resembling my ***Amazon Glue*** *ETL job*'s original target `[service zones]` database and table on the same day  
**~and** I can save my working `[transform SQL]` with a name `[transform].sql` and a description in my `[service workgroup]`  
**~and** I can continue improving, running and saving my `[transform SQL]` until the output perfect matches the original target table.   

**Scale** of 8 to 11 **~and** flow features.

## üìöAppendix

<details><summary>Refactoring legacy SQL</summary>

### A. Is denormalization a good or bad idea?

Legacy denormalized SQL Transforms and their data-products should be scrutinized to understand:
* Do multiple product iterations co-exist that are being repeatedly generated at the same time?
* Do multiple product iterations share significant elements of SQL code?
* Are they expensive to run and maintain?
* Can they be broken up and re-orchestrated in a more efficient manner?
* Can they be broken up and refactored to make them easier to maintain and iterate?

### B. Balancing "Data pull" *versus* "Data push"

**Data pull:** Presentation layer BI tools are very efficient at pivoting between dimensions and aggregating data along each dimension. Because they serve up reports and visualizations only when they are needed, they have the potential of saving cost when conceived properly.

**Data push:** The optimum intermediate *Data Platform* products are *data cube*s because they generate the most value from the presentation layer's potential use cases. Their development, continued deployment, computational and product materialization costs can be offset in many ways, but ultimately their value is dependant on the numbers of users and the use-cases in the presentation layer.

**Pull overreach:** Is where the demands of the presentation layer is allowed to propagate too many very similar, yet independent data "push" pipelines. "Push", because it is where the cost of the problem is observed (multiplied by cloud running costs), will often get unfairly blamed for a problem propagated by the demands of poorly conceived "pull" requirements from the presentation layer.

**Push overreach:** Is where over-engineering of "push" pipelines actually reduces the potential portfolio of presentation layer product realizations. In the worst case scenario, a data pipeline will converge on just a single data product with no options for further data wrangling in the presentation layer because the data product does not resemble a data cube. Over use of "push" is rightly blamed for this effect when it is caused by not understanding the real needs of presentation layer users.
