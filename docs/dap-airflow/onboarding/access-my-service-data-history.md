# Access my service data history from Amazon Athena

1. **Access Amazon Athena:**   
   In your web browser, log in to your AWS account, navigate to the AWS Management Console, and open Amazon Athena. 
   
   * Users new to Amazon Athena should start here ‚ñ∫  
   **[DAP‚á®flowüìöAmazon Athena](https://playbook.hackney.gov.uk/Data-Platform-Playbook/dap-airflow/onboarding/access-my-Amazon-Athena-database)** 

2. **Selecting and understanding your database:**   
   Ensure that you have selected `[my service raw zone]` from the list box under the "**Database**" section on the left side of the Athena interface.

   * Athena‚Äôs databases are actually catalogs of the data stored in the AWS S3 storage buckets and folders, which we collectively call a **data lake.** From the top level, data lakes are divided by zone, then by service, then by service database. 

   * The service database folders are represented by **databases** in Athena which which are labeled in the reverse ‚Äú***service*\-*database*\-*zone‚Äù format***. The zone suffix labeling has the following meaning:  
     * ‚Äú-**raw-zone**" for databases where data tables arrive after they are ingested from a service database and whose specification depends upon the source of that data.  
     * ‚Äú-**refined-zone**" for databases where data goes whenever it is transformed and whose specification is implemented by data analysts and engineers when developing their data pipelines.  
     * ‚Äú-**trusted-zone**" for databases containing the product tables whose specification is developed and agreed upon by data analysts and engineers in collaboration with their data users.

   * You can find more information on how Amazon S3 may be used to organize data ‚ñ∫[**here**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/organizing-objects.html)

3. **Explore the tables in your database:**   
   Beneath the "**Database**" section on the left of the Athena interface, expand the "**‚ñ∫ Tables**" section to find the list of tables available from `[my service raw zone]` database.

   * This is how Athena presents tables from the S3 data lake. Elsewhere, in S3‚Äôs folder structure, tables are represented by folders below the service database folder.

   * In this implementation, the table names here are all suffixed with ‚Äú**\_history**‚Äù to remind us that each table may contain several daily generations of data going back in time.  

4. **Expand each table:**   
   Click on each table name to expand it and observe the complete list of columns for that table.

5. **Verify the tables and columns:**   
   Compare the listed tables and their columns with `[my service database]` to ensure they match, including the column names and their respective data types.

   * Occasionally the automatic data type translation will yield unexpected results. The critical need for manually checking these columns is to ensure there will never be any data lost. For example, if integer precision is lost.

   * Always be aware of date translation. Dates can be transmitted in specialized date formats, various numerical formats, or various textual formats. If we‚Äôre unlucky these might need some coded reconciliation afterwards to make them properly useful again.

6. **Observe the partition columns:**  
   Scroll to the bottom of the column list to find the partition scheme. This will comprise four or more partition columns shown with the partition data type alongside eg. ***string (Partitioned).***

      ![Fig 6](../images/access-my-service-data-history-six.png)

      * We prefer not to overburden Data Analysts with data partitioning overheads when developing their transformation queries.

      * Document 1.4.2 takes care of that ‚ñ∫ [DPF-185 DOCUMENTATION 1.4.2 Access my current service data from Amazon Athena](https://docs.google.com/document/d/183-wviy16D1AGEO4UuoSxnjz8rNsuNvD5tP1PLRJF0M/edit?usp=sharing) 

      But it helps to be aware of the fundamental differences between a traditional database and a data lake that records the entire history of our data.

   * Because tables are ingested or otherwise transformed daily (the most common frequency), each table folder, in the S3 data lake, must be subdivided by **generation**, so that the underlying technology of the data platform can quickly access the only current data needed for its transformation. 

   * Generations are organized hierarchically using S3 folders represented by the following partition column strings:   
      * ***Year*** eg. ‚Äú**import\_year**‚Äù eg. ‚Äò2024‚Äô (the current year)  
      * ***Month*** eg. ‚Äú**import\_month**‚Äù eg. ‚Äò06‚Äô (the current month eg. June)  
      * ***Day*** eg. ‚Äú**import\_day**‚Äù eg. ‚Äò05‚Äô (5th day of the current month)  
      * ***Date*** eg. ‚Äú**import\_date**‚Äù eg. ‚Äú20240605‚Äù (5th June 2024\)  

      We might see alternatives to "**import\_**‚Ä¶" column prefixes such as ‚Äú**transform\_**‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äú**generation\_**‚Ä¶‚Äù, or observe combinations of generation the prefixes, to indicate data imported and transformed at different times.

   * We can also have other non-generational partition types, for example, we might want to subdivide the data after it is ingested in some other useful way, eg. by currency or historicity to facilitate data governance management and optimize our data pipelines even further.
