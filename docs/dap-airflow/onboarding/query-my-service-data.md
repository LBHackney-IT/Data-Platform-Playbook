# Query and analyze my service data with Amazon Athena

1. **Access Amazon Athena:**   
   In your web browser, log in to your AWS account, navigate to the AWS Management Console, and open Amazon Athena.

   * Users new to Amazon Athena can start here **‚ñ∫**  
   **[DAP‚á®flowüìöAmazon Athena](../onboarding/access-my-Amazon-Athena-database)** 

2. **Select your workgroup:**  
   Ensure you have selected `[my service]` from the list box next to ‚ÄúWorkgroup‚Äù.  
     
3. **Explore your database:**   
   * Ensure you selected `[my service raw zone]` from the list box under the "**Database**" section on the left side of the Athena interface. 
   * Ensure you can expand the lists under "**‚ñ∫ Tables**" and "**‚ñ∫ Views** and can expand those further to reveal their column names and data types, as follows:

      - "**‚ñº Tables**"  
      **[üìöMy service data history](../onboarding/access-my-service-data-history)** 

      - "**‚ñº Views**"  
      **[üìöMy current service data](../onboarding/access-my-current-service-data)** 

4. **Familiarize yourself with SQL queries:**   
   You will need to understand the concepts and basic requirements of writing SQL queries. This includes knowing how to select columns, filter data, join tables, etc.
