# What must happen before I can begin DAP‚á®flow?
![DAP‚á®flow](../images/DAPairflowFLOWleft.png)  

## 1. Is your `[service]`‚Äôs data now available on the Data Analytics Platform (DAP)?
Your `[service]` manager or the **DAP Platform Team** will have told you about this.

## 2. Are you using your **Hackney Council** Google Account?
You‚Äôll always need to be logged into your **Hackney Council** Google account via your web browser when following the **DAP‚á®flow** onboarding tasks.

## 3. Your manager must add you to the DAP Access Google Group
Ask your `[service]` manager to add your name to the [DAP Access Google Group](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/2465464?hl=en), aka your `[service workgroup]`. Your manager may need to contact the **DAP Platform Team** if this is their first time adding someone to the group.

## 4. Access granted!
Once your name is added, you will be granted  
- appropriate access to the [Hackney Council AWS Console](https://d-936715b9ec.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts).
- membership of the **‚òéÔ∏èDAP‚á®flow Hotline** Google Chat Space.

## 5. You‚Äôll receive an email, welcoming you to **DAP‚á®flow**
Check for an email from the **DAP Platform Team** welcoming you to the DAP. This email will present you with the following information needed to begin using the **DAP‚á®flow** and while following the **üìöOnboarding** documentation:  
- Your `[service workgroup]` confirming your workgroup in ***Amazon Athena*** and other places
- Your `[service role]` needed to access the ***AWS Management Console***
