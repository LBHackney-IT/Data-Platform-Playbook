# What must happen before I can begin DAP⇨flow?

### 1. Is your service’s data now available on the Data Analytics Platform (DAP)?
Your manager or the **DAP Platform Team** will have told you about this.

### 2. Are you using your Hackney Council Google Account?
You’ll always need to be logged into your Hackney Council Google account via your web browser when following the **DAP⇨flow** onboarding tasks.

### 3. Your manager must add you to the DAP Access Google Group
Ask your manager to add your name to the [DAP Access Google Group](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/2465464?hl=en) for `[my service]`. Your manager may need to contact the **DAP Platform Team** if this is their first time adding someone to the group.

### 4. Access granted!
Once your name is added, you will be granted  
- appropriate access to the [Hackney Council AWS Console](https://d-936715b9ec.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts).
- membership of the **☎️DAP⇨flow Hotline** Google Chat Space.

### 5. You’ll receive an email, welcoming you to **DAP⇨flow**
Check for an email from the **DAP Platform Team** welcoming you to the DAP. This email will present you with the following information needed while using the **DAP⇨flow** service and using the **📚Onboarding** documentation:  
- `[my service]` name confirming my workgroup
- `[my service role]` needed to access the AWS Console
- `[my service raw zone]` is the database where you will find your data.
- `[my service database]` confirms where your data came from.
