# Before you begin DAP⇨flow
![DAP⇨flow](../images/DAPairflowFLOWleft.png)  

## 1. Are you using your **Hackney Council** Google Account?
You’ll always need to be logged into your **Hackney Council** Google account via your web browser when following the **DAP⇨flow** onboarding guides.

## 2. Is your `[service]`’s data now available on the Data Analytics Platform (DAP)?
If your `[service]` manager or the **DAP Platform Team** have not already informed you about this, please visit the [**📊Data Analyst Community**](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAKdvhyKA?cls=7) *Google Chat Space* to ask the question there. Someone from the team should be able to help you, and if your `[service]`’s data isn't available right now, this might be planned for near future.

## 3. You must be added to your `[service access group]`([*Google Group*](https://groups.google.com/all-groups?q=saml-aws-data-platform-collaborator)) 
Depending on your circumstance there are various ways that could happen:  

- If your `[service]` manager (or representative) also manages your [`[service access group]`](https://groups.google.com/all-groups?q=saml-aws-data-platform-collaborator) then you can ask them to [add you](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/2465464?hl=en). That is the quick and easy way.

- Otherwise, when **DAP⇨flow** access is requested via any other means the **DAP Platform Team** must interact with your manager before they can add you, for example:
    * An access request directed at **Data Analytics Platform's** [***Halo support portal***](https://support.hackney.gov.uk/portal/service?btn=204&root_category=13&autolog=true&shownewticket=true&id=137) sent via [**data.analytics.platform@hackney.gov.uk**](mailto:data.analytics.platform@hackney.gov.uk). Always make sure managers are cc'd in to email so that requests can be authorized as quickly as possible and we can be sure what [service] you belong to.  
    * Asking for help via the [**📊Data Analyst Community**](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAKdvhyKA?cls=7) *Google Chat Space*.  

## 4. Access granted

**`Fig. 4`** ![Fig. 4](../images/begin-four.png)

You should receive an email, similar to ***fig.4*** above, which will confirm the *actual name* of the group you were added to. So henceforth in the 📚Onboarding articles, wherever you read `[service access group]` you should interpret that to be the group named in that email. 

You will then be be granted:  

👉  Access to the [Hackney Council AWS Console](https://d-936715b9ec.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts) 

Please allow a couple of hours for the permissions to propagate across Hackney's AWS platform before chasing **DAP Platform Team** if that hasn't happened.

👉  Access to the [**☎️DAP⇨flow Hotline**](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAZYTZYPE/w4EMQuK-9QA/w4EMQuK-9QA?cls=10) *Google Chat Space* 

All members of `[service access group]`s with access to **DAP⇨flow** are now automatically members of this *Google Chat Space*. This is where you will interact with the **DAP Platform Team** when you need help, encounter a problem or need to chase a request while performing a task.  

## 5. Welcome!

Please take some time to go and introduce yourself on the [**☎️DAP⇨flow Hotline**](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAZYTZYPE/w4EMQuK-9QA/w4EMQuK-9QA?cls=10)!

You will need some basic information, tailored to your `[service]`'s implementation, to get you started on your DAP⇨flow journey and to enable effective use of the [**DAP⇨flow📚Onboarding**](../introduction#📚Onboarding) playbook. 

👉  [**DAP⇨flow📚Welcome**](../onboarding/welcome)  

This next onboarding article will show you where to find the information you need for that. Please make a note of your `[service access group]` named in that email because you will be needing it to access that information.

**~or** my `[service]`manager authorizes the **DAP Platform Team** to add my name to the [`[service access group]`](https://groups.google.com/all-groups?q=saml-aws-data-platform-collaborator) as requested
