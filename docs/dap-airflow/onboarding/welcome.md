:::note BEHAVIOR  
### Welcome to DAP‚á®flow!
**Measures** the **DAP Platform** behavior:  

**Given** my name was added to the my [`[service access group]`](https://groups.google.com/all-groups?q=saml-aws-data-platform-collaborator)  
**~and** I received an email confirming that and the *actual name* of that group  
**~and** I was granted membership of [**‚òéÔ∏èDAP‚á®flow Hotline**](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAZYTZYPE/w4EMQuK-9QA/w4EMQuK-9QA?cls=10) *Google Chat Space*  
**~and** I was granted access to the [**Hackney Council AWS Console**](https://d-936715b9ec.awsapps.com/start/\#/?tab=accounts)  

**When** I follow this ‚ñ∫ [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k30M7Hh8WLttL5T5JVGbnKvSLNX7lVSg?usp=drive_link)  
**~and** open the folder with the same *actual name* of my `[service access group]`  
**~and** there open the document called "welcome"   

**Then** that "welcome" document will give me the list of information I need to begin using **DAP‚á®flow** while following the **üìöOnboarding** documentation:  
- `[service access group]`
- `[service workgroup]`
- `[service role]`
- `[service raw zone]`
- `[service database]`  
**~and** enable me to find the resources i need while using the AWS Console

**Scale** of 3 to 6 **~and** flow features.
