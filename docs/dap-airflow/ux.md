# 📚`UX`
![DAP⇨flow](../dap-airflow/images/DAPairflowFLOWwide.png)  

## 📚User eXperience criteria
The **📚Onboarding** links below will take you directly to the **📚`UX` criteria** within each of the **DAP⇨flow** onboarding guides.

We start by using BDD language to map the flow of a process: 

**a)** This forms our behavior acceptance test or `UX` criteria. If this test fails then there likely was a change to the software, interface or underlying data. When we do not control how software works, it's BDD process description is often not as succinct as we would like, like if we wanted to develop our own software to perform the same task. 

**b)** By measuring a process in terms of steps or features, we can better understand how to improve it's operation or efficiency. This practice aligns with the Lean principle of "creating an uninterrupted workflow".

Software interfaces often require users to perform many additional steps to perform a single task. Measuring these steps or "flow features" helps us quickly identify processes likely to have poor user experience (UX) and helps find opportunities to cut waste.

Counting the number of extra steps needed to complete a task is a process mapping technique used in [*Lean*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_government) to identify potential *"motion waste"*. 

**⇨** Flow feature scores of zero indicate ideal single-step processes.  
**+** Added one or steps represents opportunity for improvement.

## Migration onboarding

The following guides were updated in parallel to those above, intended for existing **Data Platform** users who are migrating to **DAP⇨flow** with their existing database features left intact.  

:::info MIGRATION
When the documentation for these guides is finally completed, we will only need to consider the UX for the guides that are different to the guides above, and where guides are substantially the same they will be removed with the side-bar menu pointing back to the original. In some cases we will just enhance the original guide to accommodate both new and migrated **DAP⇨flow** users.
