## Resources
- [PyDeequ README][pydeequ-readme]

## Prerequisites

Update the job arguments of your Glue job to include:
- Extra jars: `--extra-jars = s3://dataplatform-stg-glue-scripts/jars/deequ-1.0.3.jar` 
- Extra Python files: `--extra-py-file = s3://dataplatform-stg-glue-scripts/python-modules/pydeequ-1.0.1.zip` 
- Metrics repository S3 target location using the template format: 
  `--deequ_metrics_location = s3://dataplatform-stg-EXAMPLE-zone/quality-metrics/department=EXAMPLE/dataset=EXAMPLE/deequ-metrics.json`
  
:::caution

There is a [defect with PyDeequ][defect with PyDeequ] which causes the Glue Spark session to hang.
While this issue still exists, we recommend wrapping your data quality verification code in a "try/finally" block (see example [here][try-finally-example]).

```python
try:
  ...
finally:
    spark_session.sparkContext._gateway.close()
    spark_session.stop()
```
:::

### Example Check

Here is an example of using deequ checks to validate a dataframe, and storing related metrics to S3.
The `description_of_work` column is checked to be complete, and `work_priority_priority_code` between
1 and 4 inclusively. 
There is also the option to include a hint message on each of the checks which will be 
displayed to the user in the event there is a failing constraint to help diagnose the problem.
For example, the `hasMin` check has the hint message: "`The minimum(work_priority_priority_code) >= 1')`". 

```python
from helpers import get_metrics_target_location
from pydeequ.checks import Check, CheckLevel
from pydeequ.repository import FileSystemMetricsRepository, ResultKey
from pydeequ.verification import VerificationSuite, VerificationResult, RelativeRateOfChangeStrategy

metrics_target_location = get_metrics_target_location()

metricsRepository = FileSystemMetricsRepository(spark_session, metrics_target_location)
resultKey = ResultKey(spark_session, ResultKey.current_milli_time(), {})

checkResult = VerificationSuite(spark_session) \
    .onData(df) \
    .useRepository(metricsRepository) \
    .addCheck(Check(spark_session, CheckLevel.Error, "data quality checks") \
        .hasMin("work_priority_priority_code", lambda x: x >= 1, 'The minimum(work_priority_priority_code) >= 1') \
        .hasMax("work_priority_priority_code", lambda x: x <= 4, 'The maximum(work_priority_priority_code) <= 4')  \
        .isComplete("description_of_work")) \
    .saveOrAppendResult(resultKey) \
    .run()
    
checkResult_df = VerificationResult.checkResultsAsDataFrame(spark_session, checkResult)
checkResult_df.show()
```

Here is a [list of checks][pydeequ-checks] that are available to use.

### Example Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection uses historic metrics to determine if a value is invalid.

:::caution
You can only run an anomaly check if there are historic metrics results in the metrics repository you are using.
If no historic metrics results exist, you will get the below error message:

```markdown
Can't execute the assertion: requirement failed: 
There have to be previous results in the MetricsRepository!!
```

To avoid this error, run the standard verification constraint checks first (see [Example Check](#example-check) section above) and then add your anomaly constraint checks afterwards.
:::

For example, we check if the size of a dataframe has increased by more than twice the previous size.

```python
from helpers import get_metrics_target_location, cancel_job_if_failing_quality_checks
from pydeequ.verification import VerificationSuite, VerificationResult
from pydeequ.repository import FileSystemMetricsRepository, ResultKey
from pydeequ.anomaly_detection import RelativeRateOfChangeStrategy

metrics_target_location = get_metrics_target_location()

metricsRepository = FileSystemMetricsRepository(spark_session, metrics_target_location)
resultKey = ResultKey(spark_session, ResultKey.current_milli_time(), {})

anomalyVerificationSuite = VerificationSuite(spark_session) \
    .onData(df) \
    .useRepository(metricsRepository) \
    .addAnomalyCheck(RelativeRateOfChangeStrategy(maxRateIncrease = 2.0), Size())

cancel_job_if_failing_quality_checks(VerificationResult.checkResultsAsDataFrame(spark_session, anomalyVerificationSuite.run()))

# Only update the metrics repository if cancel_job_if_failing_quality_checks succeeds.
# Otherwise the next time anomaly check runs it will compare against "incorrect" metrics.
anomalyVerificationSuite.saveOrAppendResult(resultKey).run()
```

Here is a [list of anomaly detection types][pydeequ-checks] that are available to use.

### Providing tags to metrics for verification constraint checks

You can add tags to your verification metrics which may be helpful when reviewing the metric
results for a particular job. 
To do this, include a dictionary containing key value pairs in the `ResultKey` as shown in example below:

```python
import sys
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions

args = getResolvedOptions(sys.argv, ['JOB_NAME'])

resultKey = ResultKey(spark_session, ResultKey.current_milli_time(), {
    "source_database": source_catalog_database, 
    "source_table": source_catalog_table,
    "glue_job_id": args['JOB_RUN_ID']
})
```


### Stopping Glue jobs when constraint checks fail

In order to ensure that only trusted data is outputted from your Glue job, it is important
to make an assertion against your constraints to check that they have been satisfied.

You can do this by including a helper function called `cancel_job_if_failing_quality_checks()`
in your script (see [helpers.py][helpers.py] for more info).
You can see an example usage in the [Example Anomaly Detection](#example-anomaly-detection) section.

When a constraint check fails, the Glue job will fail and, an error message will be provided which might look something like
the below message:

```markdown
  Exception: data quality checks. Value: 1.0 does not meet the constraint requirement!
  The minimum(work_priority_priority_code) >= 2
  | Anomaly check for Size(None). Value: 486.0 does not meet the constraint requirement!
```

Multiple constraint failures are delimited by a `|` character in the error message.

### Email notifications of failing Glue jobs

Each time a Glue job fails as a result of failing constraint checks, an email notification with details of the error message is sent to the respective department, and their subscribed members.

The message will include:
- Name of the Glue job
- Error message from the failing constraint check
- Time of failure
- Job start time
- Job end time
- Job last modified time
- A link to log in to Hackney SSO and view the Job run details

In order to receive email notifications, you will need to ensure that you are subscribed to receive emails from your department's [Google group][google-groups] and that you have confirmed your subscription to receive AWS Notifications when prompted.


:::important
Ensure the **PlatformDepartment** tag is correctly set in the _Advanced details_ section in the Glue job's _Job Details_ (see [Using Glue Studio][using-glue-studio]).
